CS 6240 : MapReduce -- Northeastern University, Seattle -- Spring 2018

* Repository contains a MapReduce application to compute TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores from 60 GB of Wikipedia XML data
* Application launched on AWS EMR coupled with S3
* Returns the top 20 most relevant articles for the words from the dataset
* Motivation : To learn how to compute TF-IDF scores using MapReduce for large datasets. While the insights gathered from this application are trivial, the concepts could easily be extended to different data sets to provide important insights.
* Authors : Rucha Damle, Will Hembree
